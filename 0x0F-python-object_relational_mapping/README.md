# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Project

This project, led by **Jessica Oviahon**, demonstrates the implementation of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python using MySQL as the backend database. It provides examples and scripts for interacting with a MySQL database using both the MySQLdb module and SQLAlchemy ORM. This project is ideal for Python developers who want to understand ORM concepts and work with databases in Python applications.

## Project Objectives

### Learning ORM Concepts
- Understand the concept of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and its benefits in Python development.

### Database Interaction
- Learn how to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script, execute SQL queries, and perform CRUD operations.

### MySQLdb Module
- Gain familiarity with the MySQLdb module for direct interaction with MySQL databases.

### SQLAlchemy ORM
- Explore the SQLAlchemy ORM library for abstracting database interactions and simplifying Python code.

### Virtual Environment
- Set up and utilize Python virtual environments for managing project dependencies and isolating project environments.

### Documentation
- Practice writing clear and concise documentation for scripts, modules, and project components.

### Scripting
- Develop Python scripts to perform various tasks such as querying databases and manipulating data.

### Code Quality
- Adhere to coding standards, maintainability, and readability guidelines to produce high-quality code.

### Project Management
- Manage project tasks, deadlines, and version control using Git and GitHub repositories.

### Testing and Validation
- Verify the functionality of scripts and modules through testing and validation procedures.

These objectives aim to provide **Jessica Oviahon** with a comprehensive understanding of ORM principles and practical skills in working with databases using Python.
