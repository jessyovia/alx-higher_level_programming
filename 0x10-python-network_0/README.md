# Project Mirror: "0x10. Python - Network #0"

## Overview
This project consists of a simple Bash script designed to retrieve the size of the response body from a given URL using cURL. It serves as a convenient tool for individuals who need to quickly and efficiently determine the size of the content returned by a web server when provided with a URL. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or anyone else working with web-based applications, this script can be invaluable for monitoring or analyzing HTTP responses.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this script is to provide a straightforward solution for measuring the size of HTTP response bodies. By using cURL, it simplifies the process of fetching data from web servers and extracting relevant information, such as the content size. This can be particularly useful in various scenarios, including debugging network issues, optimizing web applications, or analyzing website performance.

## How It Works
The Bash script utilizes the cURL command-line tool to send a request to the specified URL and retrieve the response body. It then extracts the size of the response body in bytes and displays it to the user. This straightforward approach allows for quick and accurate measurement of the content size, making it easy to gather essential metrics for further analysis or troubleshooting.
