# JavaScript - Web jQuery

This project is aimed at individuals looking to enhance their skills in front-end web development, particularly in using JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate the DOM and interact with APIs. It provides a hands-on learning experience for beginners to understand the fundamentals of front-end programming and AJAX requests.

The project involves tasks such as selecting HTML elements, modifying styles and content dynamically, making AJAX GET and POST requests, and listening to DOM and user events. By completing this project, participants will gain practical knowledge in building interactive web applications and understand how jQuery simplifies front-end development.

This project is suitable for aspiring web developers, students learning JavaScript and jQuery, or anyone interested in improving their proficiency in front-end programming. It provides a foundation for further exploration into advanced web development concepts and frameworks.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why jQuery makes front-end programming easier.
- Select HTML elements using both JavaScript and jQuery.
- Differentiate between ID, class, and tag name selectors.
- Modify HTML element styles and content.
