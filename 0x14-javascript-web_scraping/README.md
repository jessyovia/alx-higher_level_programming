# Web Scraping with JavaScript

## Overview
The "Web Scraping with JavaScript" project focuses on implementing web scraping techniques using JavaScript. It aims to provide a practical demonstration of how to manipulate JSON data, make HTTP requests, and interact with the file system in a Node.js environment. By following this project, learners will gain insights into the power of JavaScript for web scraping tasks and develop essential skills for data extraction and manipulation from web sources.

## Requirements
**Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Node.js version 14.x.  
**Coding Standards:** Code should be semistandard compliant with AirBnB style.  
**Dependencies:** Install semi-standard and request modules using npm.  
**Documentation:** Ensure README.md file is present and contains project information.

## File Structure
- `your_script.js`: Main JavaScript file for web scraping tasks.
- `README.md`: Project documentation file.
- (Add any other files or directories as needed)

## Notes
- The request module is deprecated but is still widely used for web scraping in JavaScript.
- Ensure all JavaScript files are executable and adhere to the specified coding standards.
- Plagiarism or copying code from external sources is strictly prohibited.
